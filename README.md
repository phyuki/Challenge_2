# Challenge 2: Register of Compass Scholarship Program classes

The goal in this technical challenge is to develop a RESTful API using the Spring Boot framework in Java, which is capable of handling the basic operations of the four HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.  
For the development of the API, the Java programming language will be used in conjunction with the Spring Boot framework and the MySQL database. Additionally, other relevant dependencies will be incorporated for specific purposes, such as testing and documentation, ensuring a comprehensive solution that adheres to RESTful standards.
## Implemented features

* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Patch)  
* OpenAPI (using Swagger)  
* ProblemDetails [(RFC 7807)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807)  
* HATEOAS  
* Unit Tests (JUnit 5, Mockito)  
* Integration Tests (MockMvc)  

## API documentation
To access the API documentation, it is necessary to start the application and then access the specified endpoint: **/swagger-ui/index.html.** This route will provide an interactive interface that details all relevant information about the API, including available endpoints, accepted parameters, and response formats.
